## Why Spiel

Read-aloud tools are either expensive subscriptions or cloud services that see
everything you read. Spiel is neither: the neural voice
([Kokoro-82M](https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M)) runs **on your own Mac** at
`127.0.0.1`. No account, no telemetry, no cloud. Turn off Wi-Fi and it still works.

Built for students, researchers, and anyone who reads a lot and wants to pay nothing.

## Features

- ▶️ **One click to listen** — open any article or PDF, press Play
- 🖍 **Word-by-word highlighting** that follows the voice, with auto-scroll
- 📄 **Reads PDFs** — research papers, web-hosted or local, extracted on-device with pdf.js
- 👆 **Click anywhere to listen from there** — click a paragraph, reading jumps to it
- ✂️ **Read your selection** — select text on any page for instant playback
- 🎚 **4 curated voices** (American/British, male/female) and speed up to 3×
- ⏱ **Time-remaining estimate** at your current speed
- 🧹 **Smart skipping** — URLs, [reference brackets], (parentheses) — your choice
- 🌙 **Dark mode** everywhere, matched to the page
- 🔒 **100% local** — text-to-speech happens at `127.0.0.1`; nothing ever leaves your machine

## Install (2 steps, ~3 minutes)

**Requirements:** Mac with Apple Silicon (M1 or newer) · ~8 GB free disk · Chrome.
*(Intel Macs and Windows/Linux: [on the roadmap](#roadmap).)*

### Step 1 — The extension

**[⬇ Download the latest spiel-extension.zip](https://github.com/preet01/spiel/releases/latest)**, unzip it, then:

1. Open `chrome://extensions`
2. Toggle **Developer mode** ON (top-right)
3. Click **Load unpacked** and pick the unzipped folder
4. Pin the 🎙 Spiel icon to your toolbar

> Keep the folder somewhere permanent (not Downloads) — Chrome loads the extension
> from that exact path. *(A one-click Chrome Web Store install is coming.)*

<details>
<summary><strong>Or build from source</strong></summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/preet01/spiel.git
cd spiel && npm install && npm run build
```

Then Load unpacked → pick the `dist/` folder.

</details>

### Step 2 — The voice engine

Paste this in the **Terminal** app and press Enter:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/preet01/spiel/main/install.sh | bash
```

Wait ~2 minutes. When your Mac says **"Spiel is ready"** out loud, you're done —
open any article and press Play in the Spiel popup.

<details>
<summary><strong>What does that command install, exactly?</strong></summary>

Everything goes under `~/.spiel` (plus one LaunchAgent). The script:

1. Checks your Mac (macOS, disk space)
2. Installs the [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) Python manager if missing
3. Downloads [Kokoro-FastAPI](https://github.com/remsky/Kokoro-FastAPI) (pinned commit, Apache-2.0)
4. Downloads the Kokoro voice model (~330 MB, Apache-2.0)
5. Creates a LaunchAgent so the engine auto-starts on boot, bound to `127.0.0.1` only — unreachable from the network
6. Starts it and speaks a test sentence

It's ~300 lines of plain bash — [read it yourself](install.sh) before running, as you should with any `curl | bash`.

</details>

## How it works

```
┌────────────────────────── Your Mac ──────────────────────────┐
│                                                              │
│  Chrome                            Kokoro voice engine       │
│  ┌──────────────────┐   text   ┌───────────────────────┐     │
│  │ Spiel extension  │ ───────▶ │ FastAPI + Kokoro-82M  │     │
│  │ (UI, highlights) │ ◀─────── │ at 127.0.0.1:8880     │     │
│  └──────────────────┘   audio  └───────────────────────┘     │
│                                                              │
└────────────── nothing crosses this line ─────────────────────┘
```

The extension extracts the article ([Readability](https://github.com/mozilla/readability))
or PDF ([pdf.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/), on-device), sends it
sentence-by-sentence to the local engine, and plays the audio with synchronized
word highlighting driven by Kokoro's word timestamps.

## Privacy

- No analytics, no telemetry, no accounts, no remote servers.
- The voice engine listens on `127.0.0.1` only — your own machine, not your network.
- The only network traffic Spiel ever creates is the one-time download of the engine and model at install.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| Popup says "Voice not installed" | Run the Step 2 command; the popup updates itself when the engine is up |
| Installed but silent | Engine log: `~/Library/Logs/spiel-voice-engine.log` · installer log: `~/.spiel/install.log` |
| Local PDF won't read | Enable **Allow access to file URLs** for Spiel at `chrome://extensions` |
| Port 8880 already in use | Another app owns it — `lsof -iTCP:8880 -sTCP:LISTEN` to find it |
| First play of the day is slow | The model warms up on first request (~5–15 s); Spiel keeps it warm afterwards |
| Uninstall everything | `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/preet01/spiel/main/uninstall.sh \| bash` + remove the extension at `chrome://extensions` |

## Contributing

Issues and PRs welcome — especially **Intel Mac / Windows / Linux ports**, new
voices, and Firefox support. The codebase is small and documented:

| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `src/background.ts` | Playback state machine, TTS fetches, prefetch cache |
| `src/content.ts` | Article extraction, word highlighting, floating player |
| `src/offscreen.ts` | Audio playback (Web Audio, autoplay-exempt) |
| `src/pdf-content.ts` | On-device PDF text extraction (pdf.js) |

The build has two quality gates: a strict TypeScript check and a dist-completeness
check that fails if any runtime file is missing. Before contributing, read
[`LESSONS.md`](LESSONS.md) — every past bug, its root cause, and the pre-flight
checklist that keeps them from coming back.

```bash
npm run build      # typecheck → bundle → icons → verify dist/ completeness
npm run package    # dist/ → spiel-extension.zip
```

## Roadmap

- [ ] **True one-click:** run the voice inside Chrome via WebGPU (no Terminal step at all)
- [ ] Chrome Web Store listing
- [ ] In-PDF page highlighting (Spiel Reader view)
- [ ] Windows & Linux installers
- [ ] More voices and languages
- [ ] Firefox support
